# My new black jack game
This project just started from [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/bMYCWccL-3U) and goes on now <br>
<br>
Also, card sprites are from [open game art](https://opengameart.org/content/cards-set) and the favicon is from [Poker icons created by Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/clover_105219) <br>
Finally, This game is almost done while still in development so any issues or pull requests you can create are welcome. Thanks in advance!<br>
<br>
Knowable plans:
* I already know there is a quite rare bug in which your total sum is different than the displayed cards sum <br> 
* I'm still in search of a better background image <br>
* I'm planning to add bets and poker chips later <br>
