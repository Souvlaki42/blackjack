# [Blackjack Game](https://blackjack.souvlaki.me)

This project just started from [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/bMYCWccL-3U) and goes on now. <br>

Credits:

- Card sprites are from [open game art](https://opengameart.org/content/cards-set)
- The favicon is from [Poker icons created by Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/clover_105219) <br>

This game is almost done while still in development so any issues or pull requests you can create are welcome.<br>
(Special thanks to [Delta](https://github.com/delta911ee) for his bug fixes.)<br>

Future plans:

- [x] I am aware that there is a quite rare bug in which your total sum is different than the displayed cards sum. <br>
- [x] I'm still in search of a better background image. <br>
- [ ] I'm planning to add bets and poker chips later. <br>
